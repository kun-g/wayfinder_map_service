# MCP service carries the versioned exploration workflow

The MCP service carries the cross-tool exploration workflow in initialization instructions and locally sufficient descriptions for its four business tools. The complete workflow is authored once in repository Markdown, independently versioned with SemVer, and deterministically built into optional Resource and Prompt projections plus the mandatory runtime guidance. A connected compatible client therefore does not depend on a copied Skill, repository-relative file or conversation prompt for correct Map operation.

## Considered options

- A copied Skill or repository file keeps workflow delivery client-specific and can leave a client aware of a path it cannot read.
- A separately maintained code/YAML authority or committed generated copy creates a second workflow body that can drift.
- A fifth workflow tool, or mandatory Resource/Prompt use, weakens the four-tool business seam and relies on client capabilities that are not portable.
- Hot reload can mix workflow contracts within one running process and session.

## Consequences

The first 512 characters of server instructions must be independently safe, tool descriptions must remain locally actionable, and Resources/Prompts remain optional. Workflow changes require a SemVer increase, deterministic rebuild, process restart and cross-client acceptance appropriate to their compatibility impact. This decision reinforces [ADR 0001](0001-remote-map-is-authoritative.md) and [ADR 0002](0002-mcp-tools-are-the-primary-interface.md); it changes neither Map authority nor the four business tools.
