# Wayfinder Map Service agent instructions

Start by reading `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/spec/v1.md`. Read relevant files under `docs/adr/` before changing architecture or product semantics.

M1 and the local MCP/SQLite service are accepted. New exploration Maps use the product MCP workflow in `docs/agents/exploration-mcp.md`. Rollback and deletion remain separate post-M1 iterations on their existing GitHub planning Maps; read `docs/planning/README.md` before resuming either effort. Keep deployment, OAuth, PostgreSQL, rendering, and plugin packaging outside the accepted local slice unless the user changes the scope.

Use the domain language in `CONTEXT.md`. Record a newly settled domain term there. Add an ADR only for a hard-to-reverse, surprising trade-off with meaningful alternatives.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Implementation uses GitHub Issues in `kun-g/wayfinder_map_service`; the existing rollback/deletion planning Maps also remain there. Read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` before querying or mutating GitHub. New exploration Map state uses Wayfinder MCP; read `docs/agents/exploration-mcp.md` before creating, finding, resuming or advancing one. The private M1 Project board and synchronization rules are documented in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use GitHub labels; see `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`; see `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Matt Pocock workflows

Project-local skills live in `.agents/skills/`: `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `wayfinder`, `grill-with-docs`, `grilling`, `domain-modeling`, `prototype`, `research`, and `triage`.

Invoke `wayfinder` for work that spans more than one agent session, `prototype` for a disposable artifact that answers a design question, `domain-modeling` when changing the glossary or recording an ADR, and `grilling` when a human decision genuinely blocks progress. The project-local `wayfinder` skill routes new exploration state through MCP. Use skills as methods, while `docs/spec/v1.md` remains the product contract.

GitHub Issues coordinate implementation and preserve the existing rollback/deletion planning Maps. New exploration Maps use the product MCP as sole authority. Completed historical planning decisions and prototypes are frozen under `docs/archive/`; accepted specifications live in `docs/spec/`. These development records remain separate from product Map state.

Skill provenance, upstream commit, license, and installed hashes live in `docs/agents/skills-provenance.md`, `docs/agents/skill-sources.json`, `docs/agents/installed-skill-hashes.json`, and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/`.
